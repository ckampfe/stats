From July/2015 to July/2016 I wrote one post a week, collecting various links I had been reading, and pulling out relevant passages from the articles into quotes.

This is a quick trend analysis of these posts using [Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) and [Gorilla-REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/).

Depends on [boot-gorilla](https://github.com/ckampfe/boot-gorilla) to provide
an interface to Gorilla-REPL.

# to run locally
